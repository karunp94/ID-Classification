This Python project leverages computer vision techniques to classify ID cards into two categories based on their strap colour in real time. By analyzing video streams or camera input, the system identifies the color of the strap and assigns the ID card to the corresponding category. Whether youâ€™re enhancing security systems or streamlining access control, this project provides a practical solution for automated classification.

Features:
* Real-time strap color detection using OpenCV
* Efficient classification of ID cards based on strap color using Machine Learning
* Minimal latency for immediate decision-making
* Easy integration with existing surveillance or access control systems
